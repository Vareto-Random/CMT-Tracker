# CMT-Tracker
Clustering of Static-Adaptive Correspondences for Deformable Object Tracking (CMT) in Pyhton and C++
http://www.gnebehay.com/cmt/

Clustering of Static-Adaptive Correspondences for Deformable Object Tracking (CMT) is an award-winning object tracking algorithm, initially published under the name Consensus-based Tracking and Matching of Keypoints for Object Tracking at the Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision 2014, where it received the Best Paper Award. A more detailed paper was published at the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2015. CMT is able to track a wide variety of object classes in a multitude of scenes without the need of adapting the algorithm to the concrete scenario in any way. Experiments have shown that CMT is able to achieve excellent results on a dataset that is as large as 77 sequences. A C++ implementation (CppMT) is freely available under the BSD license, meaning that you can basically do with the code whatever you want. Additionally, the original Python research code is still available for reference.
